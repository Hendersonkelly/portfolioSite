    <p><strong>About the Project</strong>Our class was assigned to build a hero RPG (Role Playing Game) using the newly learned javascript knowledge we had acquired using Object Oriented Programming. As a Disney adult, I based my characters and stories on Disney characters. The game begins with Ellie (from UP) with health points and balloons (currency) and she is on an adventure "in the great wide somewhere". Along the way she meets a total of 5 villains, she must fight and defeat using a series of attack actions or a weapon bought from the fantasy CostCo.</p>

    <p><strong>Built With:</strong> JavaScript, Object Oriented Programming</p>
    <p><Strong>Usage:</Strong> You must clone the repo and play it through your terminal window to play the game. Once it is cloned you will start and follow the prompts given. You will have access to your health information after and during every battle and you will have access to the number of balloons you have collected at the end of a fight. After completing every fight you will be given the option to go to the store to purchase weapons. You will get an opportunity to use these weapons as the fight begins and during the fight to aid your victory.</p>

    <p><strong>Learning/Challenges: </strong> I truly enjoyed this project. I had fun with the weapon items and the subtle references to Disney movies along the way. Storytelling is important in a game that is all done in the terminal without the use of HTML and CSS to support your meaning.</p>

    <p>Challenges came as this was my first real project. The most difficult portion that allowed me to grow the most was keeping up with the hero's inventory and their ability to change it.</p>
