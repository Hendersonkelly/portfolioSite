    <p> <strong> About:</strong> This project was a capstone project for a full-stack development program. Pocket Somm is a responsive application that allows a user to save wines they enjoyed as well as scan a wine menu and ask for a pairing with an entree. There is a camera, Optical Character Recognition and OpenAI to support these goals as well as a PostgreSQL database to store user information and favorites. The idea came out of the experience of the creators. One of the creator's partners is a sommelier and was great to have around at dinner time when it was time to order. The creators decided to find a way to bring that expertise to anyone new or who felt unknowledgeable about the wine choices available at any given restaurant. </p>

    <p><strong> Technologies Used : </strong> React
        PostgreSQL
        Cloudinary
        OpenAI
        MaterialUI
        React-Camera
        Tesseract (OCR)
        CSS</p>

    <p><strong>Usage: </strong> Simply register on the site with a name, email and password. You will be directed to the login screen. Once logged in you will choose to view your wine list or pair a wine from a menu. If you choose to pair you will be navigated to a camera to take a picture of a wine list.
    </p>
    
    <div class="portfolio-item-individual-imgs">
        <img height="250em"  src="./img/pocketSommapp3.png" alt="">
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <img height="250em"  src="./img/pocketSommapp3.png" alt="">
       </div>
  
    <p>
        Once the picture is taken, you will be able to choose to keep it or retake. If you choose to keep, Optical Character Recognition will pickup the words from your menu and you will be navigated to the pairing suggestions page where you will enter your meal to pair. Once submitted you will recieve your suggestons based on your wine menu.

    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> My partner and I saw many things that were not feasible in the 2 weeks given, but we have plans for the camera to be incorpiorated in the posting part of the App as well as be able to give more functionality to the posts like editing and adding favorites to incoprorate a filter./</p>
   

    <p><strong>Learning/Challenges:</strong>This was a project that we decided would be mobile first design as that is how it would be best used. Designing mobile first streched us but ultimately made us better developers. We also ventured out to lear n new technologies like Tessaract.JS an (OCR) as well React-Camers and OpenAI that neatly flowed one to the next. JWT Authentication was also difficult but rewarding when completed.
